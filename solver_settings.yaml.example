# Solio Solver Settings Configuration
# 
# This file defines solver parameters that will be applied before running optimization.
# Only includes settings that have been tested and confirmed to work with Solio's UI.

# Solver timeout in seconds (how long to wait for optimization to complete)
# Default: 300 (5 minutes)
# Note: This is a local timeout for our script, not sent to Solio
timeout: 300

# Horizon: Number of gameweeks to optimize ahead (1-10)
# Lower values = faster solves, less forward planning
# Higher values = slower solves, better long-term planning
# Default: 10 gameweeks
horizon_weeks: 10
